novel/significant design decisions: We decided to implement all the commands to go through argv[] in order to properly capture each one from the user. We also have all error conditions in check for anything that is not the required input mentioned in the Assignment 3 rubric. 

Extrafeatures/algorithms/functionality: We decided to split each thread into separate functions and work towards a whole mentality at the end.
